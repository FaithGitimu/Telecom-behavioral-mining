project overview

The primary objective of this notebook is to perform behavioral mining and segmentation on a telecom customer dataset. By analyzing historical service usage, billing, and support interactions, we aim to identify distinct behavioral traits and customer groups and understand which behaviors are most strongly associated with churn.
